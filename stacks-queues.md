# Stacks and Queues

A stack is a data structure that consists of nodes. Each node can be pushed and popped onto the stack using either a FILO, First In Last Out, or LIFO, Last In First Out, method. It is similar to a stack of plates in which the last one on the stack is the first removed.

A queue is another data structure that has a FIFO, First In Forst Out, or LILO, Last In Last Out, method. It is similar to standing in line where the first person in line is served first.
