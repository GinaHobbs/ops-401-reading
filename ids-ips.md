# Intrustion Detection and Prevention Systems

## The Pros and Cons of Network Instrusion Detection Systems

A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is an imoprtant part of an organizations security, but it's just one aspect of many others. An IDS is capable of identifying threats and wen it does it notifies the system administrator. An IDS is capable of detecting infections, spyware, accidental information leakage, security policy violations, unauthorized clients and servers and even configuration errors. An IPS is very similar to an IDS, but it is able to stop threats. However, it can also deny legitimate traffic so it's not suitable for everything.
