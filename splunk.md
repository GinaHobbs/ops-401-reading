## Is Cybersecurity Automation the Future?

Automating tasks that are people-driven allows businesses to focus on more productive problem solving activities. This can lead to innovation and create a more resilient organization from a cybersecurity standpoint. SOAR products are tools that orchestrate activities between other security tools and perform automation activities in response to identified threats. As organizational complexity increases it can lead to significant risk if cybersecurity can't manage the changing environment by properly defending against threats.
