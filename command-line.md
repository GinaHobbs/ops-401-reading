# The Command Line

Commands can be entered into the command line by typing a linux command which can then be followed by an option, such as ls -l. 

# Basic Navigation

There are multiple commands for navigating the command line. One is pwd, which stand for print working directory. This prints the current directory. ls is another command that lists everything in the current directory. Another command is cd which stands for change directory and is used to navigate to another directory using either a relative or absolute path. 

# More About Files

Everything in linux is a file. Files have different extensions, such as .exe, .txt or .png. The type of file extension denotes what type of file it is. There are also hidden files which are denoted by a '.' before the file name, such as '.hidden'.

# Manual Pages

Manual pages are a linux tool that allows you to look up linux commands. To use manual pages you type the command 'man' followed by the command that you want to look up. To exit the manual pages press 'q' to quit. It is possible to search the manual pages by typing 'man -k' followed by the search term. 

# File Manipulation

To create a directory you use the command 'mkdir', short for make directory, followed by the directory name. Creating a directory to store files in allows one to easily find files because they are organized in a specific way rather than all being housed in one flat directory. To remove a directory the command 'rmdir', short for remove directory, is used followed by the name of the directory you wish to remove. To create a blank file the command 'touch' is used followed by the name of the file. To copy a file the command 'cp' is used. To move a file or directory the command 'mv' is used followed by the source of the file you wish to move and then followed by the location of where you wish it to move it to. 'mv' can also be used to rename directories or file by typing the name of the file or directory and then the new name that you wish it to have. 'rm' is used to remove files.
