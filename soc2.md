# The Ultimate Guide to SOC 2 Compliance

SOC 2 applies to service providers that host customer data in the cloud. It is primarily geared to SaaS businesses but can encompass any business that stores customer data like this. SOC 2 isn't a specific set of rules, but rather a framework that indicates a business is secure, available, has integrity, confidentiality and privacy. Having a SOC 2 certificate is not enough to prove you are 100% secure but it's a certification that instills trust in customers.

# The History of SOC 2

Originally Certifies Public Accountants (CPA's) conducted audits to report on the ffectiveness of internal financial controls. Over time, the audit started to transform into a way of reporting on the effectiveness of a company's security controls. In 2010 the American Institute of Public Accountants created SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports to allow companies to externally validate their state of security. SOC 1 focuses on financial reports, and SOC 2 focuses on the business processes and security.
