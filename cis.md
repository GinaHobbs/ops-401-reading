# CIS Benchmarks

CIS Benchamrks are published by the Center for Internet Security and are the best practices for securing IT systems, software and networks. There are more than 140 CIS Benchmarks. They are developed though a consensus-based process involving cybersecurity communities, each of which identifies, refines and validates security best practices. CIS is most commonly known for its CIS Controls, which is a guide of 20 safeguards and countermeasures for effective cyber defense. CIS COntrols provides a checklist that organizations can implement to significantly reduce their cyber-attack surface. They also provide CIS hardened images that enable enterprises to have a cost effective way of performing computer operations. They are more secure than a standard virtual image and limits the vulnerabilities that can lead to a cyber attack.
